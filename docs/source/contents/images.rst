Examples of opening and writing :abbr:`PGM (Portable Gray Map)` and
:abbr:`PPM (Portable Pixmap)` images in Python are given.
Then, we will play with image data. Finally, we will code some primitive transforms of images.

.. note::

    Examples of this section require **Python 3.9** (or higher), **Numpy** and **Matplotlib**.

    If you need help with Python for scientific use, you can check this set of tutorials:
